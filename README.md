# 🛡️ AdBlock Detection Script

This is a JavaScript script designed to detect the presence of an **adblocker** on a user's browser. If an adblocker is detected, it prompts the user with a message to disable their adblocker in order to continue.

> ✅ **Quick Use**: You can simply include this line in your HTML to enable adblock detection:
>
> ```html
> <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitriskleov/AdBlocker-Detector/refs/heads/main/assets/v2.js"></script>
> ```
>
> This will automatically detect adblockers and display a message if one is active.

- **Iframe-based Ad Loading** – Attempts to load an ad from a specified URL inside an iframe.
- **Message Display** – If an adblocker is detected, a message is shown asking the user to disable their adblocker.
- **Export AdBlocker Status** – Logs the adblocker status (`'yes'` or `'no'`) to the console and exposes it as a global variable (`window.adBlocker`).
